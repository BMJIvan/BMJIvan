### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is a brief story of what I have been doing for the last 7 years

### Thesis
Design and implement  a Wireless device and an augmented reality application 

- About the Wireless device, I used the following devices: HC-05, MPU6050, PIC18F2220, 2 pushbuttons and a led. The microcontroller was programmed in C using MPLAB IDE X.

- About the augmented reality application, I used a plugin to read the text string sent by the Wireless device and the Vuforia tool for image recognition. The app was programmed with C#.

The objective is to generate a platform that allows engineers to be able to interact and experiment with physical systems to improve their learning of physics concepts. 


### AI/ML/DS
Algorithms: Linear and logistic regresiÃ³n, Naive-Bayes, singular vector decomposition (SVD), principal component analysis (PCA), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), K-means, support vector machines, decision tree, random forest, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), gradient descent, and policy gradient.

From gradient descent: Artificial neural network (ANN), recurrent neural network (RNN), convolution neural network (CNN), Autoencoder (AE), restricted Boltzmanâ€™s machines (RBM), self-organizing maps (SOM), and Generative neural network (GAN).

From policy gradient: Deep Q-learning (DQN), and asynchronous actor-critic agent (A3C). 

Mesures of central tendency: mean, median, percentile, and mode. 

Mesures of statistical dispersiÃ³n: variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and interquartile range.

Mesures of distributions: skew, kurtosis. 

Validation: Relative standard error RSE, cross validation, confusiÃ³n matrix, precisiÃ³n, recall, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, silhoutte coefficient, dendrogram and mean squared error (MSE).

Neural network: Dropout, batch normalization,  padding, pooling, 

Computer vision: color space, scale, rotate, blurring, maskin, bitwise, histogram, threshold, edge detection.
