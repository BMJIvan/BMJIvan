### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is a brief story of what I have been doing for the last 7 years

### Thesis
Design and implement  a Wireless device and an augmented reality application 

- About the Wireless device, I used the following devices: HC-05, MPU6050, PIC18F2220, 2 pushbuttons and a led. The microcontroller was programmed in C using MPLAB IDE X.

- About the augmented reality application, I used a plugin to read the text string sent by the Wireless device and the Vuforia tool for image recognition. The app was programmed with C#.

The objective is to generate a platform that allows engineers to be able to interact and experiment with physical systems to improve their learning of physics concepts. 

### AI/ML/DS
Algorithms: Linear and logistic regresiÃ³n, Naive-Bayes, singular vector decomposition (SVD), principal component analysis (PCA), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), K-means, support vector machines, decision tree, random forest, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), gradient descent, and policy gradient.

From gradient descent: Artificial neural network (ANN), recurrent neural network (RNN), convolution neural network (CNN), Autoencoder (AE), restricted Boltzmanâ€™s machines (RBM), self-organizing maps (SOM), and Generative neural network (GAN).

From policy gradient: Deep Q-learning (DQN), and asynchronous actor-critic agent (A3C). 

Mesures of central tendency: mean, median, percentile, and mode. 

Mesures of statistical dispersiÃ³n: variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and interquartile range.

Mesures of distributions: skew, kurtosis. 

Validation: Relative standard error RSE, cross validation, confusiÃ³n matrix, precisiÃ³n, recall, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, silhoutte coefficient, dendrogram and mean squared error (MSE).

Neural network: Dropout, batch normalization,  padding, pooling, 

Computer vision: color space, scale, rotate, blurring, maskin, bitwise, histogram, threshold, edge detection. 

### Design and instrument of processes that involve the mechatronic for technological development 
- Research and implementation of the Box2D physics engine to create 13 simulations using the LibGDX framework in the Android Studio development environment programming with Java.

- Research and implementation of the OpenGL2.0 graphics generation tool to generate trajectories and bar graphs.

- Documentation of the configuration of the development enviroment and creation of the simulations.

### Education
- Artificial vision systems were implemented together with neural networks for real-time image processing, recognition and tracking. These systems were deployed using MATLAB, LabVIEW and its Vision library, and the Arduino libraries.

- Android mobile applications related to virtual reality and augmented reality were implemented, implemented in the Unity video game engine, programming in C#. Touch screen, gyroscope, accelerometer and GPS were used.

- Development of practices with 8-bit PIC microcontroller programming in assembler and C. LEDs, pushbuttons, 7-segment display array, LED matrix, I2C and USART communication were used.

- Development of practices with the NEXYS 2 test card (FPGA) with the VHDL language, buttons, LEDs and 7-segment displays were used.

- Modeling, simulation and control of systems such as: simple, double and inverted pendulum, direct and alternating current electric motors, RLC electric circuits, and OPAMS.

- 3D modeling in CATIA, SOLIDWORKS and Blender
